Bindkey Examples
================

Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:

     bindkey -d

Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode entries are
marked with [A].

     bindkey -k k1 select 1

Make the "F1" key switch to window one.

     bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo

Make `foo' an abbreviation of the word `barfoo'. Timeout is disabled so
that users can type slowly.

     bindkey "\024" mapdefault

This key-binding makes `C-t' an escape character for key-bindings. If
you did the above `stuff barfoo' binding, you can enter the word `foo'
by typing `C-t foo'. If you want to insert a `C-t' you have to press
the key twice (i.e. escape the escape binding).


     bindkey -k F1 command

Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape (besides `C-a').


Bindkey Control
===============

 - Command: mapdefault
     (none)
     Tell screen that the next input character should only be looked up
     in the default bindkey table.

 - Command: mapnotnext
     (none)
     Like mapdefault, but don't even look in the default bindkey table.

 - Command: maptimeout timo
     (none)
     Set the intercharacter timer for input sequence detection to a
     timeout of TIMO ms. The default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with
     no arguments shows the current setting.

     Flow Control
************

   `screen' can trap flow control characters or pass them to the
program, as you see fit.  This is useful when your terminal wants to use
XON/XOFF flow control and you are running a program which wants to use
^S/^Q for other purposes (i.e. `emacs').

* Menu:

* Flow Control Summary::        The effect of `screen' flow control
* Flow::                        Setting the flow control behavior
* XON/XOFF::                    Sending XON or XOFF to the window


Virtual Terminal
****************

   Each window in a `screen' session emulates a VT100 terminal, with
some extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other
terminal types can be emulated.  The commands described here modify the
terminal emulation.

* Menu:

* Control Sequences::           Details of the internal VT100 emulation.
* Input Translation::           How keystrokes are remapped.
* Digraph::                     Entering digraph sequences.
* Bell::                        Getting your attention.
* Clear::                       Clear the window display.
* Info::                        Terminal emulation statistics.
* Redisplay::                   When the display gets confusing.
* Wrap::                        Automatic margins.
* Reset::                       Recovering from ill-behaved applications.
* Window Size::                 Changing the size of your terminal.
* Character Processing::        Change the effect of special characters.

  The following is a list of control sequences recognized by `screen'.
`(V)' and `(A)' indicate VT100-specific and ANSI- or ISO-specific
functions, respectively.

Digraph
=======

 - Command: digraph [preset]
     (none)
     This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two
     characters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the
     resulting character is inserted in the input stream. For example,
     if the user enters `a"', an a-umlaut will be inserted. If the
     first character entered is a 0 (zero), `screen' will treat the
     following characters (up to three) as an octal number instead.
     The optional argument PRESET is treated as user input, thus one
     can create an "umlaut" key.  For example the command `bindkey ^K
     digraph '"'' enables the user to generate an a-umlaut by typing
     `CTRL-K a'.

  Bell
====

 - Command: bell_msg [message]
     (none)
     When a bell character is sent to a background window, `screen'
     displays a notification in the message line.  The notification
     message can be re-defined by this command.  Each occurrence of `%'
     in MESSAGE is replaced by the number of the window to which a bell
     has been sent, and each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the
     definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).
     The default message is

          'Bell in window %n'

     An empty message can be supplied to the `bell_msg' command to
     suppress output of a message line (`bell_msg ""').  Without
     parameter, the current message is shown.

  - Command: vbell_msg [message]
     (none)
     Sets the visual bell message. MESSAGE is printed to the status
     line if the window receives a bell character (^G), `vbell' is set
     to `on' and the terminal does not support a visual bell.  The
     default message is `Wuff, Wuff!!'.  Without parameter, the current
     message is shown.

 - Command: vbellwait sec
     (none)
     Define a delay in seconds after each display of `screen' 's visual
     bell message. The default is 1 second.


Clear
=====

 - Command: clear
     (`C-a C')
     Clears the screen and saves its contents to the scrollback buffer.
